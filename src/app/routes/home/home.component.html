      Taking data from an automated OCR process and comparing it to the existing LOS data, the Title Workflow is a workstation that proto-types the ability for processing/UW to have a one stop place to handle all of the title workflow needs.  The application will provide the users with the ability to preview documents associated with title research, OCR data side by side with Empower data, and the ability to send updates directly to Empower.

      A dashboard features outstanding loans to be worked on, and gives flags around complete, data missing, data miss-match for each data section giving a very high level overview of the loan status.  Loans being worked will indicate locked state, allow for document final stamping, and audit log to ensure change tracking.

      Version 2.0 of Skills based routing. Loan Delegator is a combination of administration dashboard and a rules engine that will provide complex logic to assign loans to resources. This version will be applied to LD Wholesale and for Underwriters. The dashboard allows management of resources, pods, personal skills, state limitations, PTO (vacation time) and existing capacity in order to provide assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the assignment has occurred, the dashboard provides reporting and the ability to resolve unassigned loans, or review assignments and manually reassign. Finally the dashboard will allow an administrator to kick off a manual job, that would otherwise run on  a schedule.

      This is still a very early design. The process here is to allow for a loan officer to pre-pay (subscription based) for leads that would be delivered daily to the users CRM pipeline. These leads would be exclusive to the loan officer and would not be redistributed or dialed by the contact center.  Prototype images here show a possible workflow for loan officer experience of signup and subscription.
